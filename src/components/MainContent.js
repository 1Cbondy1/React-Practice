            <p>I’ve always had a strong interest in design and technology. These interests are what drew me to LSU's School of Architecture, where I learned the fundamentals of visual and spacial design. It’s also where I picked up my first coding chops through a minor in Digital Media Arts. I took the concepts I learned into practice, as a scenic designer for broadcast television in New York City. After working for a few years, I felt the pull towards a career in an emerging and faster-paced industry.</p>
